```
Subject: SSL Certificate Expiry Almost Caused Our Outage Last Week üò∞

Hi [NAME],

I noticed you're a DevOps Engineer at [COMPANY] - probably managing dozens of SSL certificates across different environments?

Last week, we almost had a production outage because an SSL certificate expired overnight. The client's e-commerce site went down for 2 hours, costing them ‚Ç¨15,000 in lost sales.

I built SSL Monitor Pro to solve this exact problem:

‚úÖ **Automated SSL monitoring** for all your domains
‚úÖ **Proactive alerts** via WhatsApp, Email, Slack
‚úÖ **7-day free trial** - no credit card required
‚úÖ **GDPR compliant** - EU data residency

Perfect for companies like [COMPANY] with multiple domains.

### **TEMPLATE 2: CTO/Technical Director (Warm Outreach)**

```
Subject: How [COMPANY] Can Avoid SSL Certificate Downtime

Hi [NAME],

As CTO at [COMPANY], you're probably dealing with the complexity of managing SSL certificates across multiple domains and environments.

The reality is harsh: **SSL certificate expiry is the #1 cause of website downtime** in 2024.

Most companies discover expired certificates only when:
- Customers can't access the website
- Revenue drops to zero
- Brand reputation suffers

I created SSL Monitor Pro to solve this for technical teams:

üîí **Enterprise-grade monitoring** for unlimited domains
üì± **Multi-channel alerts** (WhatsApp, Email, Slack, Webhook)
üöÄ **5-minute setup** - no complex integrations
üí∞ **ROI in days** - prevents costly outages

**Real results:**
- 99.9% uptime guarantee
- 0 SSL-related outages for our clients
- Average setup time: 3 minutes

Ready to protect [COMPANY]'s digital assets?

**Free 7-day trial**: https://ssl-monitor.pages.dev
**Quick demo call**: https://calendly.com/sre-engineer-vm/30min

### **TEMPLATE 3: System Administrator (Problem-Solution)**

```
Subject: SSL Monitoring That Actually Works (Unlike Nagios üòÖ)

Hi [NAME],

Sysadmin to sysadmin - I know the pain of managing SSL certificates across multiple servers.

Nagios, Zabbix, and other monitoring tools are great, but they're not built for SSL certificate management. The alerts are confusing, the setup is complex, and they miss critical expiry dates.

I got tired of 3 AM calls about expired certificates, so I built SSL Monitor Pro:

‚úÖ **Purpose-built for SSL monitoring**
‚úÖ **Crystal clear alerts**: "example.com expires in 7 days"
‚úÖ **WhatsApp integration** - get alerts where you actually see them
‚úÖ **No server installation** - cloud-based monitoring
‚úÖ **GDPR compliant** - EU data residency

**What makes it different:**
- Alerts are actionable and clear
- Setup takes 3 minutes, not 3 hours
- Works with any hosting provider
- API-first design for automation

Perfect for managing certificates across [COMPANY]'s infrastructure.

**Try it free for 7 days**: https://ssl-monitor.pages.dev
**Need help setting up?** WhatsApp: +420 721 579 603

Cheers,
Vladyslav
SSL Monitor Pro

P.S. I'm offering free setup assistance for the first 10 sysadmins who sign up this month.

### **TEMPLATE 4: Security Engineer (Security Focus)**

```
Subject: SSL Certificate Management: The Security Gap Most Companies Miss

Hi [NAME],

As a Security Engineer, you understand that SSL certificates are more than just encryption - they're a critical security control.

But here's the problem: **expired SSL certificates create security vulnerabilities** that attackers actively exploit.

Recent research shows:
- 67% of companies have expired SSL certificates in production
- 23% of security incidents involve certificate-related issues
- Average time to detect expired certificates: 72 hours

Traditional monitoring tools treat SSL as an afterthought. That's why I built SSL Monitor Pro with security teams in mind:

üîê **Security-first design**
üìä **Compliance reporting** for audits
üö® **Immediate alerts** for certificate issues
üîí **Zero-trust architecture** - no server access required
üìã **Audit trails** for compliance

**Perfect for security teams that need:**
- Proactive certificate monitoring
- Compliance documentation
- Integration with existing security tools
- Clear accountability and reporting

**Security demo**: https://calendly.com/sre-engineer-vm/30min
**Free trial**: https://ssl-monitor.pages.dev

P.S. We're SOC 2 Type II compliant and offer custom security integrations.
