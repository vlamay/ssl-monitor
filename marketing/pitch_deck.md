## Demo Script

### Opening (2 minutes)

I'm going to show you how we can prevent SSL certificate outages that could cost your business thousands of koruna."

### Problem Statement (3 minutes)
"Let me ask you a question: How do you currently monitor your SSL certificates?

[Wait for response]

Most companies either:
1. Don't monitor at all (risky!)
2. Check manually (time-consuming)
3. Use basic uptime monitors (no SSL focus)

The problem is: SSL certificates expire without warning, causing website outages."

### Solution Demo (8 minutes)
"Let me show you our solution in action:

1. **Dashboard**: Real-time view of all certificates
2. **Monitoring**: Automated checks every hour
3. **Alerts**: Telegram notification 30 days before expiration
4. **Analytics**: Historical data and trends

[Live demo of dashboard]

Here's what happens when a certificate is about to expire..."

## Objection Handling

### "Too Expensive"
"Let me show you the math:

- ROI = 1,667%

Plus, you have a 14-day free trial to test it."

### "We Already Monitor SSL"
"Great! What system do you use?
[Wait for response]

How many domains do you monitor?
How often do you check?
What happens if you miss an expiration?

Our system checks every hour and alerts 30 days before expiration."

### "We're Too Small"

- Higher impact of outages

Our Starter plan is designed for small businesses at 3,000 CZK/month."
