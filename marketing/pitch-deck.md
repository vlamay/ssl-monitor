## 📊 SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

```
💥 THE SSL CERTIFICATE CRISIS

❌ 67% of companies have expired SSL certificates
❌ Average downtime cost: €15,000 per incident  
❌ 72 hours average time to detect expired certificates
❌ 23% of security incidents involve certificate issues

Real Impact:
• E-commerce sites lose revenue every minute
• Customer trust is damaged instantly  
• SEO rankings drop significantly
• Security vulnerabilities are exposed

"Last month, our main domain expired and we lost €25,000 in 4 hours"
- CTO, European E-commerce Company
```

## 📊 SLIDE 3: CURRENT SOLUTIONS FAIL

```
🔧 WHY EXISTING SOLUTIONS DON'T WORK

Traditional Monitoring Tools:
❌ Nagios/Zabbix - Complex setup, confusing alerts
❌ Internal scripts - Break easily, no redundancy
❌ Manual checks - Human error, inconsistent
❌ Hosting provider tools - Limited scope, poor UX

Common Problems:
• Alerts arrive too late or not at all
• Setup takes days, not minutes
• False positives cause alert fatigue
• No integration with modern communication tools
• Complex configuration and maintenance

"The alerts from our monitoring system are so confusing, 
we usually ignore them until something breaks"
- DevOps Engineer, Tech Startup
```
