Subject: Quick question about [Company]'s SSL certificates

Hi [Name],

I noticed [Company] manages multiple websites/domains. 
I wanted to reach out because SSL certificate expiry is one of 
the most common causes of unexpected downtime (seen it happen 
to companies like LinkedIn, Spotify).

We built SSL Monitor Pro specifically to prevent this. 
It automatically checks your SSL certificates hourly and 
alerts you before they expire.

Would you be interested in a free SSL audit of your domains?

Best,
[Your Name]
