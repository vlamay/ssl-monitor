# N8N Migration to EU - Step by Step Guide

## Option A: Migrate Existing N8N to Frankfurt (EU)

### Step 1: Backup Current N8N Workflows

# 2. Settings → Delete Service
# 3. Confirm deletion
```

### Step 3: Create New N8N in Frankfurt
```bash
# Render Dashboard:
# 1. New → Web Service
# 2. Repository: your-n8n-repo

# 5. Deploy
```

### Step 4: Restore Workflows

### Migration Steps:
1. Sign up at app.n8n.cloud
